We  saw  Mr.  Nathan  radley  (booâ€™s  older  brother  ) 
standing  with  a  shotgun  by  his  
side.    atticus  was  there,  and  miss  maudie,  miss  stephanie 
crawford, miss rachel (dills aunt), and mr. avery.

what happened, asked jem, as if he didnt know.
miss maudie replied, mrs. radley says he shot at a negro in his collard patch.
did he hit him?
No, said miss stephanie.  they shot in the radleys window to see 
if they could get a look at boo.  they said that if i didnt want to go with them i could go straight 
home and keep my mouth shut about it.  i said, jem, dont...
jem said, scout, im telling you for the l
ast time, shut your trap or go home 
i declare 
to the lord youre gettin more like a girl every day!  so, i shut up and joined them.  we snuck 
under a barbed wire fence and through a creaky gate into the radleys yard.  we had to be very 
quiet, and i was so nervous!  we gave dill a boost up to look in the window, but he didnt get them free, 
so he kicked his pants off and started running in his underware.
